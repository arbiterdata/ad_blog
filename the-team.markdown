Owner, founder and CEO - Edward Franklin

Edward trained as an accountant at PwC, has a degree in economics and econometrics and has held a number of positions in the software industry.

Edward decided to found ArbiterData when he realised that one of the biggest problems in the software development industry was developers not trully understanding the needs of the businesses that use their software and a lack of accountability for the software produced.

ArbiterData is based on the philosophy that software should be built by the people who would use it.
